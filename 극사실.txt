Create EXACTLY ONE SINGLE [INSECT NAME] in hyper-realistic painting style. CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ONLY ONE INSECT must appear in the entire image - no multiples, no duplicates. Use photorealistic rendering techniques with impeccable detail, precise lighting, and lifelike textures. The insect must be positioned in a 3/4 side-angled view (NOT top-down), showing the insect from a diagonal perspective with clear side profile. Render every microscopic detail with perfect clarity - individual hairs, reflective eye facets, translucent wing membranes, intricate leg joints, and delicate antennae. Capture the subtle play of light on chitin surfaces, creating realistic highlights and shadows. Achieve stunning texture and color accuracy that appears indistinguishable from a high-resolution macro photograph. Pure white background with absolutely no decorative elements. Reference style: contemporary wildlife macro photography transformed into immaculate hyper-detailed painting technique.
